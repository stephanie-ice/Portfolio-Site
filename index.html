      <p>Hi! I am a student at UCLA Extension, and this is my first project online. 
        Over the years, I have shown interest in Star Trek, yoga, organization, 
        minimalism, education, documentaries, and sea shells. 
        My favorite activity is discovering something new. I hope to learn how to 
        code so that I can begin a career in web development, but also so that 
        I can pursue fields such as data science. 
        I hope to learn more about game theory and cryptography, and how 
        mathematical technologies like the block chain may be the next step towards
        our social evolution into a post-scarcity future;
        not unlike Gene Rodenberry's vision in Star Trek!
