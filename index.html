        <p>Hi! I am a student at UCLA Extension, and this is my first project online. 
          Over the years, I have shown interest in Star Trek, yoga, organization, 
          minimalism, education, documentaries, and sea shells. 
          My favorite activity is discovering something new. I hope to learn how to 
          code so that I can begin a career in web development, but also so that 
          I can pursue fields such as data science. 
          I hope to learn more about game theory and cryptography, and how 
          mathematical technologies like the block chain may be the next step towards
          our social evolution into a post-scarcity future;
          not unlike Gene Rodenberry's vision in Star Trek!
